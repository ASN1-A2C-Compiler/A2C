  New releases from http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/

  Version 1.2.6, 2/7/03, [C. Scott Ananian]
   Renamed 'assert' function 'ASSERT' to accomodate Java 1.4's new keyword.
   Fixed a bug which certain forms of comment in the JLex directives section
     (which are not allowed) to be incorrectly parsed as macro definitions.
  Version 1.2.5, 7/25/99-5/16/00, [C. Scott Ananian]
   Stomped on one more 8-bit character bug.  Should work now (really!).
   Added unicode support, including unicode escape sequences.
   Rewrote internal JavaLexBitSet class as SparseBitSet for efficient
     unicoding.
   Added an NFA character class simplification pass for unicode efficiency.
   Changed byte- and stream-oriented I/O routines to use characters and
     java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer instead --- which means we read in
     unicode specifications correctly and write out a proper unicode java
     source file.  As a happy side-effect, the output java file is written
     with your platform's preferred newline character(s).
   Rewrote CInput to fix bugs with line-counting in the specification file
     and "unusual behaviour" when the last line of the specification wasn't
     terminated with a newline. Thanks to Matt Hanna <mhanna@cs.caltech.edu>
     for pointing out the bug.
   Fixed a bug that would cause JLex not to terminate given certain input
     specifications.  Thanks to Mark Greenstreet <mrg@cs.ubc.ca> and
     Frank B. Brokken <frank@suffix.icce.rug.nl> for reporting this.
   CUP parser integration improved according to suggestions made by
     David MacMahon <davidm@smartsc.com>.  The %cup directive now tells
     JLex to generate a parser conforming to the java_cup.runtime.Scanner
     interface; see manual for more details.
   Fixed bug with null string literals ("") in regexps.  Reported by
     Charles Fischer <fischer@cs.wisc.edu>.
   Rewrote start-of-line and end-of-line handling, closing active bug #5.
     Also fixed line-counting code, closing active bug #12.  All
     new-line handling is now platform-independent.
   Used unpackFromString more extensively to allow larger cmap, etc,
     tables.  This helps unicode support work reliably.  It's also
     prettier now if you happen to read the source to the generated
     lexer.
   Generated lexer now accepts unicode LS (U+2028) and PS (U+2029) as
     line separators for strict unicode compliance; see
     http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/
   Fixed bug with character constants in action strings.  Reported by
     Andrew Appel against 1.2.5b3.
   Fixed bug with illegal \^C-style escape sequences.  Reported by
     Toshiya Iwai <iwai@isdnet.co.jp> against 1.2.5b4.
   Fixed "newline in quoted string" error when unpaired single- or
     double-quotes were present in comments in the action phrase.
     Reported by Stephen Ostermiller <1010JLex@ostermiller.com>
     against 1.2.5b4.  Reported by Eric Esposito <eric.esposito@unh.edu>
     against 1.2.4 and 1.2.5b2.
   Fixed "newline in quoted string" error when /* or // appeared
     in quoted strings in the action phrase.  Reported by
     David Eichmann <david-eichmann@uiowa.edu> against 1.2.5b5.
   Fixed 'illegal constant' errors in case statements caused by
     Sun's JDK 1.3 more closely adhering to the Java Language
     Specification.  Reported by a number of people, but 
     Harold Grovesteen <hgrovesteen@home.com> was the first to direct me to
     a Sun bug report (4119776) which quoted the relevant section of the
     JLS (15.27) to convince me that the JLex construction actually was
     illegal.  Reported against 1.2.5b6, but this bit of code has been
     present since the very first version of JLex (1.1.1).

  Version 1.2.4, 7/24/99, [C. Scott Ananian]
   Correct the parsing of '-' in character classes, closing active 
     bug #1.  Behaviour follows egrep: leading and trailing dashes in
     a character class lose their special meaning, so [-+] and [+-] do
     what you would expect them to.
   New %ignorecase directive for generating case-insensitive lexers by
     expanding matched character classes in a unicode-friendly way.
   Handle unmatched braces in quoted strings or comments within
     action code blocks.
   Fixed input lexer to allow whitespace in character classes, closing
     active bug #9.  Whitespace in quotes had been previously fixed.
   Made Yylex.YYEOF and %yyeof work like the manual says they should.

  Version 1.2.3, 6/26/97, [Raimondas Lencevicius]
   Fixed the yy_nxt[][] assignment that has generated huge code
   exceeding 64K method size limit. Now the assignment
   is handled by unpacking a string encoding of integer array.
   To achieve that, added
   "private int [][] unpackFromString(int size1, int size2, string st)"
   function and coded the yy_nxt[][] values into a string
   by printing integers into a string and representing
   integer sequences as "value:length" pairs.
   Improvement: generated .java file reduced 2 times, .class file
     reduced 6 times for sample grammar. No 64K errors.
   Possible negatives: Some editors and OSs may not be able to handle 
     the huge one-line generated string. string unpacking may be slower
     than direct array initialization.

  Version 1.2.2, 10/24/97, [Martin Dirichs]
  Notes:
    Changed yy_instream to yy_reader of type BufferedReader. This reflects
     the improvements in the JDK 1.1 concerning InputStreams. As a
     consequence, changed yy_buffer from byte[] to char[].
     The lexer can now be initialized with either an InputStream
     or a Reader. A third, private constructor is called by the other
     two to execute user specified constructor code.

  Version 1.2.1, 9/15/97 [A. Appel]
   Fixed bugs 6 (character codes > 127) and 10 (deprecated string constructor).

  Version 1.2, 5/5/97, [Elliot Berk]
  Notes:
    Simply changed the name from JavaLex to JLex.  No other changes.

  Version 1.1.5, 2/25/97, [Elliot Berk]
  Notes:
    Simple optimization to the creation of the source files.
     Added a BufferedOutputStream in the creation of the DataOutputStream
     field m_outstream of the class CLexGen.  This helps performance by
     doing some buffering, and was suggested by Max Hailperin,
     Associate Professor of Computer Science, Gustavus Adolphus College.

  Version 1.1.4, 12/12/96, [Elliot Berk]
  Notes:
    Added %public directive to make generated class public.

  Version 1.1.3, 12/11/96, [Elliot Berk]
  Notes:
    Converted assertion failure on invalid character class 
     when a dash '-' is not preceded with a start-of-range character.
     Converted this into parse error E_DASH.

  Version 1.1.2, October 30, 1996 [Elliot Berk]
    Fixed BitSet bugs by installing a BitSet class of my own,
     called JavaLexBitSet.  Fixed support for '\r', non-UNIX 
     sequences.  Added try/catch block around lexer generation
     in main routine to moderate error information presented 
     to user.  Fixed macro expansion, so that macros following 
     quotes are expanded correctly in regular expressions.
     Fixed dynamic reallocation of accept action buffers.

  Version 1.1.1, September 3, 1996 [Andrew Appel]
    Made the class "Main" instead of "JavaLex", 
     improved the installation instructions to reflect this.

  Version 1.1, August 15, 1996  [Andrew Appel]
    Made yychar, yyline, yytext global to the lexer so that
     auxiliary functions can access them.
