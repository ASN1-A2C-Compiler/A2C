The files in this directory are for housekeeping by a2c's authors. They are
used to create all the makefiles in the system, since those makefiles need
to have different contents depending on whether they are for .NET or Mono
systems. Someone running a2c never needs to look at these files, but
is welcome to, particularly if you need to change some of the makefiles
for your environment.

ProcessMakefiles.pl takes  the base-* files and creates the .NET and Mono
versions, then pushes them out to the NET-files and Mono-files directories.
Someone running a2c probably never needs to run this program.

MakeBaseTestMakefile.pl uses dependencies.txt to generate the makefile
for the test/ directory. This makes it easier as we change the files
in test/.
